## 简介 Introduction
Features
Inverse Design from Properties to Structures: Input target band gap and formation energy to generate crystal structures that match these properties.
SLICES Encoding: Utilizes SLICES (Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) encoding to represent crystal structures.
Visualization: Generated structures can be intuitively presented through 3D visualization.
Structure Analysis: Provides detailed information about the generated structures, including chemical formula, lattice parameters, etc.
CIF File Export: Download Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) of generated structures for further analysis and use.
